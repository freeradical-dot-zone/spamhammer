-- WARNING! WARNING! READ ME! I'M NOT KIDDING! This is a giant footgun that
-- could easily make it so that you can't restore your database backups _if you
-- ignore this advice_.
--
-- When you add a PostgreSQL constraint, that constraint is evaluated when you
-- add it and then again when you change a row, e.g. by inserting or updating
-- data. That's the only time. If the constraint calls a user-defined function
-- like ours does here, and you change that function's definition, then
-- PostgreSQL won't evaluate any existing rows again. Why's that a problem? Say
-- you modify the 'frz_text_is_abusive' function in-place without dropping the
-- constraint first. Now it's possible that there will already be existing
-- statuses rows that violate the new, updated constraint. Nothing will happen.
-- PostgreSQL won't re-check them. Now if you backup the database and try to
-- restore it, the constraint *will* be evaluated on each row as it gets
-- inserted, and it will fail when it gets to one of the demon rows, and you
-- will have a sad.
--
-- Don't do that. Any time you want to edit this function, drop the constraint,
-- make your edits, and re-add the constraint. If you have bad data, PostgreSQL
-- will complain about it then and won't let you add it until you delete the
-- abusive statuses. Yes, it's slower that way. Yes, you will be so happy when
-- your next database backup/restore succeeds.
